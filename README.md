## Project Methodology & Tech Stack

- __Ideation & Project Management__
  - We used Balsamiq for our wireframes and ERDplus to sketch out the database tables.
  - Held our stand up meetings on Slack
  - GitHub Projects was used for our user stories and feature list, allowing for day to day priotization

- __Development__
  - For our front-end we used the standard HTML5 and CSS3 alongside the bootstrap framework
  - We worked with Python framework Django on the back-end to automatically iterate new pages based on user form submissions
  - Naturally we used GitHub for our version control, using forks for the team's independent development and a deployment branch that doubles as the latest stable working version
  - We are using the free tier of Elephant SQL, while it remains available, to host our database
  - Our stable website is deployed and hosted on Heroku
